--------------------

• Internet access tunneled over the Tor network:
- Websites do not see your real IP address.
- All browsing is encrypted before it leaves your device, protecting your data on insecure wireless networks.
- Bypass restrictive firewalls: you can access the entire Internet from behind ISP/corporate connections that filter websites, or when inside regions that practice online censorship. (See CONNECTIVITY NOTE below.)
- Access websites on the "dark net" of anonymous .onion web sites, only accessible in the Tor network.

• Defeat online tracking: change IP address and clear cookies/history/cache/HTML5 storage in one button.

• User-Agent spoofing option can hide the fact that you are using an iPhone/iPad.

• Ability to block third party cookies or all cookies.

See onionbrowser.com for more information & privacy caveats.

PERFORMANCE NOTE: web browsing through the anonymization network will be SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than through a non-tunneled browser.

CONNECTIVITY NOTE: App does NOT function in China, Iran, and other locations known to employ Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) censorship technology to block Tor connections.
